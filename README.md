# Hi, I'm Adithya Nair 👋  
*Molecular Biology Postgraduate | Computational Biology & Drug Discovery Enthusiast*

I am a postgraduate in *Molecular Biology* with hands-on experience in *computational drug discovery*, including molecular docking, MD simulations, and binding-affinity analysis.  
My recent work focuses on *drug repurposing against Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM)*, where I performed structure-based virtual screening, docking, and dynamics to identify potential therapeutic hits.
